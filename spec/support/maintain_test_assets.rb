# Under Rails 7 with 'cssbundling-rails' and/or the 'jsbundling-rails' gems,
# entirely external systems are used for asset management. With Sprockets no
# longer synchronously building assets on-demand and only when the source files
# changed, compiled assets might be (during local development) or will almost
# always be (CI systems) either out of date or missing when tests are run.
#
# People are used to "bundle exec rspec" and things working. The out-of-box gem
# 'cssbundling-rails' hooks into a vanilla Rails "prepare" task, running a full
# "css:build" task in response. This is quite slow and generates console spam
# on every test run, but points to a slightly better solution for RSpec.
#
# This class is a way of packaging that solution. The class wrapper is really
# just a namespace / container for the code.
#
# First, if you aren't already doing this, add the folllowing lines to
# "spec_helper.rb" somewhere *after* the "require 'rspec/rails'" line:
#
#     require 'rake'
#     YourAppName::Application.load_tasks
#
# ...and call MaintainTestAssets::maintain! (see that method's documentation
# for details). See also constants MaintainTestAssets::ASSET_SOURCE_FOLDERS and
# MaintainTestAssets::EXPECTED_ASSETS for things you may want to customise.
#
class MaintainTestAssets
  # All the places where you have asset files of any kind that you expect to be
  # dynamically compiled/transpiled/etc. via external tooling. The given arrays
  # are passed to "Rails.root.join..." to generate full pathnames.
  #
  # Folders are checked recursively. If any file timestamp therein is greater
  # than (newer than) any of EXPECTED_ASSETS, a rebuild is triggered.

  # for in "File.join(Rails.root, 'app', 'assets', 'builds')". Where files are
  # written together - e.g. a ".js" and ".js.map" file - you only need to list
  # any one of the group of concurrently generated files.
  #
  # In a standard JS / CSS combination this would just be 'application.css' and
  # 'application.js', but more complex applications might have added or changed
  # entries in the "scripts" section of 'package.json'.
